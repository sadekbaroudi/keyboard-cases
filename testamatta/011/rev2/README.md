## STLs

Pick one body file, and one switch plate and print them.

The `testamatta-011-body.stl` is taken directly from the testamatta repository above. I converted the step file to stl.  

The `testamatta-011-body-heatset-4mmDx3.5mmL.stl` is the same as the default body, except I adapted to support 4mm diameter 3.5mm length M2 heat set inserts  

The `testamatta-011-switch-plate.stl` is the default switch plate from rev 1, but adapted to support the new thumb switches  

The `testamatta-011-switch-plate-23mm-cirque.stl` is the same as the first switch plate, but a 23mm cirque mount was added. This can only be used with the VIK enabled xivik controller, not the xiao seeeduino controllers.
